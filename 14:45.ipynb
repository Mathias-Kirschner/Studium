        ">With the proliferation of digital information, text processing has become a critical function for modern computing. The ability to efficiently search and analyze text is essential for numerous applications, ranging from data mining and web indexing to bioinformatics and natural language processing. The primary focus of this paper is on the pattern-matching problem, a fundamental challenge in text processing. Given a text string \\( T \\) and a pattern string \\( P \\), the goal is to determine if \\( P \\) occurs as a substring in \\( T \\) and, if so, find all occurrences of \\( P \\) within \\( T \\).\n",

        "2. For each \\( i \\), compare the substring \\( T[i:i+m] \\) with \\( P \\).\n",

The Boyer-Moore algorithm's heuristics provided substantial efficiency gains in many cases, but its worst-case performance remained comparable to the brute-force method. The KMP algorithm demonstrated the most consistent performance across different text sizes and types, validating its theoretical optimality.\n",

        "To further enhance this project, potential improvements include:\n",
        "- **Parallelizing the Algorithms:** Implementing parallel versions to leverage multi-core processors.\n",
        "- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining the strengths of different algorithms based on the specific characteristics of the text and pattern.\n",
