        "## 1. Introduction and Problem Description\n",
        "With the proliferation of digital information, text processing has become a critical function for modern computing. The ability to efficiently search and analyze text is essential for numerous applications, ranging from data mining and web indexing to bioinformatics and natural language processing. The primary focus of this paper is on the pattern-matching problem, a fundamental challenge in text processing. Given a text string \\( T \\) and a pattern string \\( P \\), the goal is to determine if \\( P \\) occurs as a substring in \\( T \\) and, if so, find all occurrences of \\( P \\) within \\( T \\).\n",

        "## 2. Description of the Three Algorithms\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.1 Brute-Force Algorithm\n",
        "The brute-force algorithm is the simplest approach to the pattern-matching problem. It involves checking each possible position in the text \\( T \\) where the pattern \\( P \\) might start and comparing the subsequent characters one-by-one.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
        "1. Loop through each index \\( i \\) in \\( T \\) from 0 to \\( n - m \\), where \\( n \\) is the length of \\( T \\) and \\( m \\) is the length of \\( P \\).\n",
        "2. For each \\( i \\), compare the substring \\( T[i:i+m] \\) with \\( P \\).\n",
        "3. If all characters match, record \\( i \\) as a match position.\n",
        "4. Continue until all positions are checked.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Complexity:**\n",
        "- Worst-case time complexity: \\( O(nm) \\)\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2.2 Boyer-Moore Algorithm\n",
        "The Boyer-Moore algorithm improves upon the brute-force method by using heuristics to skip sections of the text, reducing the number of comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Heuristics:**\n",
        "- **Looking-Glass Heuristic:** Start comparisons from the end of the pattern and move backward.\n",
        "- **Character-Jump Heuristic:** If a mismatch occurs and the mismatched character is not in the pattern, shift the pattern past this character.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
        "1. Preprocess the pattern \\( P \\) to create the `last` occurrence function.\n",
        "2. Start aligning \\( P \\) with \\( T \\) from the end of \\( P \\).\n",
        "3. Use the heuristics to shift \\( P \\) appropriately on mismatches.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Complexity:**\n",
        "- Average-case time complexity: \\( O(n/m) \\)\n",
        "- Worst-case time complexity: \\( O(nm) \\)\n",

        "### 2.3 Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm\n",
        "The KMP algorithm further optimizes pattern matching by precomputing information about the pattern to avoid redundant comparisons.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
        "1. Precompute the failure function for \\( P \\), which indicates the next position to check after a mismatch.\n",
        "2. Use the failure function during the search to skip unnecessary comparisons.\n",

        "## 3. Description of the Text Documents Used for Testing\n",
        "For testing the implementations of these algorithms, we used a diverse set of text documents including:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Wikipedia Articles:** Large articles with varied content.\n",
        "2. **Scientific Papers:** Texts with structured format and frequent technical terms.\n",
        "3. **Social Media Feeds:** Collections of short posts from platforms like Twitter.\n",
        "4. **Bioinformatics Data:** Sequences of DNA data represented as strings of nucleotide symbols (A, C, G, T).\n",
        "\n",
        "These documents provide a comprehensive testing ground, reflecting real-world scenarios where pattern matching is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 4. Presentation and Discussion of Experimental Results\n",
        "We implemented the three algorithms in Python and ran them on the selected text documents to measure their performance. The metrics used for comparison were execution time and the number of comparisons made.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Results:\n",
        "- **Brute-Force Algorithm:** Performed well on short texts but exhibited poor scalability on larger documents.\n",
        "- **Boyer-Moore Algorithm:** Showed significant improvements in average-case performance, especially on longer texts with fewer pattern matches.\n",
        "- **KMP Algorithm:** Consistently outperformed the brute-force method and matched or exceeded the Boyer-Moore algorithm, particularly in worst-case scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Discussion:\n",
        "The experimental results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm. The Boyer-Moore algorithm's heuristics provided substantial efficiency gains in many cases, but its worst-case performance remained comparable to the brute-force method. The KMP algorithm demonstrated the most consistent performance across different text sizes and types, validating its theoretical optimality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 5. Conclusions and Prospects\n",
        "In summary, the study reaffirmed the importance of efficient pattern-matching algorithms in text processing. The KMP algorithm emerged as the most robust solution, offering a balanced approach between simplicity and efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Work:\n",
        "To further enhance this project, potential improvements include:\n",
        "- **Parallelizing the Algorithms:** Implementing parallel versions to leverage multi-core processors.\n",
        "- **Hybrid Approaches:** Combining the strengths of different algorithms based on the specific characteristics of the text and pattern.\n",
        "- **Real-time Processing:** Adapting the algorithms for real-time applications where new data is continuously added.\n",
        "\n",
        "By exploring these directions, we can develop even more powerful tools for text processing, capable of handling the ever-growing volume of digital information.\n",
